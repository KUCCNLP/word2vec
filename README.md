# Word2Vec Implementations 

Following skip-gram algorithm from Mikolov et al. 2013

* Python(3) + TensorFlow implementation ... which is a simplification of simplified tutorial from;

	<https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec>
	<https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.2/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py>

* Lua + Torch implementation

	... working ...

# Instructions

* Download the data file from the archive.
* Set FPATH_DATA to the valid path at your system.
* Time required for 200000 iterations for me was approximately 350sec.
